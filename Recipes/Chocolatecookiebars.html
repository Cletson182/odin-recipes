        <li>To the bowl of a stand mixer firtted with a paddle attachment, add the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar.
            Beat until light and fluggy, about 1-2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs and vanilla and beat until well combined, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Beat just until mixes and the dough starts sticking together.
